  <h2>ASML's deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography systems dive deep into the UV spectrum to print the tiny features that form the basis of the microchip.</h2>
  <p>Chips are made up of many layers stacked on top of one another, and it’s not necessarily the latest and greatest immersion lithography machines that are used to produce these layers. In a given chip, there may be one or two more complicated layers that are made using an EUV lithography machine, but the rest can often be printed using ‘older’ technology such as dry lithography systems. This is certainly more cost-effective for customers, since these older machines are less expensive to purchase and maintain.</p>
